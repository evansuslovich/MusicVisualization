# MusicVisualization

1. A project focused around visualizing music. 
2. Trying to use as little libraries as possible focusing on my signal processing and music analysis skills. 
3. A daily project! 


Notes: 
1. beatDetection.py: Focused on getting the BPM of a song using digital signal processing processes. 
2. pitchDetectionAlgorithm.py: Later project, realized it's a lot bigger of a project than I originally thought so I'm going to stick with just finding BPM.
3. plotWaveAudioFile.py: Plots a .wav audio file, beatDetection.py can graph using matplotlib.
